			<div class="info-text">Long hours of computer use contribute to physical, mental, and emotional stress. Millions of people make their living working at a computer for 8 or more hours per day.</div><div class="info-text"> For many this also means long periods of uninterrupted sitting with poor posture. Our bodies were not meant for such extended periods of inactivity, and the toll it takes on us is not just physical, but mental and emotional too.</div>

			<div class="info-text">By incorporating movement, stretching, and mindfulness exercises into our work routines we can better manage these stressors. The rule of thumb is 5 minutes of movement for every 30 minutes of inactivity.</div>
			<div class="info-text">Many of these movement breaks are as simple as getting up for a glass of water or walking to a colleague's desk to ask a question. But some of them should be more intentional. These more intentional breaks are what DeskLife helps with.</div>
